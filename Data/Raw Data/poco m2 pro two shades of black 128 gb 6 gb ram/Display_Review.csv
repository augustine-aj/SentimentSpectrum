delightful,ok so i got my phone on 11 nov initially it was on miui 11 and battery was fantastic after heavy usage it ran for 12 hours but problem starts after updating to miui 12 battery life reduced and i have dual 4g sim but when both sim are on 4g one sim goes automatically disconnected from network camera 48 mp is not really that good i switched from a 13 mp phone and quality is only little improved i think back camera needs improvement charging is really fast considering 5020 mah battery read more,rohit singh,saunda,202011,0,0
