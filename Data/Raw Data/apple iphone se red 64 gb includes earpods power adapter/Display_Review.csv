pretty good,however with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display the display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger as it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display,flipkart customer,hyderabad,202110,89.0,13.0
