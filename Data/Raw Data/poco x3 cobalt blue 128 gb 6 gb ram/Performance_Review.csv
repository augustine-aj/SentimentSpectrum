value for money,6gb ram along with snapdragon 732g processor is more than enough for a decent performace battery is also really good and it ll last one day easily the built quality of the phone isn t that great when you play a song audio the phone starts to vibrate and another down side of the phone is that it s heavy but you ll get used to it camera is average but macro lens isn t worth it overall the product is good and i ll recommend it,biju mt,kannur,202010,0,0

decent product,when you have used a samsung phone in android or an iphone then this phone for you is not a good choice though the facility i provides at mid budget range is good but you can opt this out as samsung are providing far better phone at the same price range battery good and long lasting with heavy use for around 2months fast charging with 33w is a plus in this display pixelrated it can be better never recommend if this is priority camera quality is not that high but fine for near objects p read more,arima sharma,ahmedabad,202108,0,0
