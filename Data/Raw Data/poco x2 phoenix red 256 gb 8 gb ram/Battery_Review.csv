just okay,battery is not promising at full charge it ll run for like 8 to 10 hours if continuosly used,hariom tiwari,deoria,202008,0,2
just okay,all those pros are overshadowed by the poor battery life of the phone even on moderate use you have to charge atleast once and on heavy usage twice everyday the only good thing about battery is the fast charging around 1hr 10min but battery drains very fast battery life for new device is less not sure how bad it would be after using for about an year or,piyush tiwari,bhatapara,202007,0,0
worth the money,battery if you keep 60hz refresh rate it will last more than 1 day moderate usage if you use 120 hz refresh rate battery will drain very fast,g rajesh customer,chittoor,202008,0,0
