simply awesome,pros 1 camera 5 out of 5 the ultrawide camera can get a little work done because in some environment photos seems a little dark then main camera 2 display 5 out 5 the display is stunning and that 120hz is criminally smooth 3 battery 4 5 out of 5 3900mah feels good enough for me but a little bit more mah and it would me much appreciated 4 sound 4 out of 5 with dolby atmos stereo speakers sounds great but the bass seems a little low than its bigger sibling s23 5 storage and ram read more,flipkart customer,new delhi,202403,4.0,0.0
great product,the size and touch of the phone is next level as the phone is not that big and you can easily use with single hand the cameras are top notch as samsung always does it only the 8k video which i did not like because it was making it too much hdr if you want to shoot videos use 4k 60 fps which works smooth for the performace it is great too as it is packed with a rocket processor not faced any problem till now,kaushik nath,hojai,0,1.0,1.0

awesome,camera and overall features are nice if you are into photography can download expert raw app by samsung and try to enhance your skills night clicks are also coming out quite good processor is superfast intensive usage is leading to heating but not into an alarming condition but bit heating is there while you are going all out overall size is quite handy which i admire a lot but the major drawback is the battery which is not upto the mark comparing to i phone 14,nikhil t m,ahmedabad,202306,19.0,5.0
